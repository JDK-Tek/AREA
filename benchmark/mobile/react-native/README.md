## **üìã Benchmark of React Native**

### **‚öôÔ∏è Installation Process (on Fedora)**

To get started with React Native on Fedora, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Install Node.js & NPM**
React Native requires **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager). You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
sudo dnf install nodejs npm
```

To check if they are installed correctly, use:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### **Step 2: Install React Native CLI**

React Native provides two main ways to create projects: the **React Native CLI** and **Expo**. Here, we‚Äôll focus on the React Native CLI.

Install the React Native CLI globally via npm:

```bash
sudo npm install -g react-native-cli
```

#### **Step 3: Install Dependencies for Android Development**

For Android development, React Native relies on **Android Studio** for emulation, compiling, and testing. You‚Äôll need to install Android Studio and set up the Android SDK.

First, install Android Studio on Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install android-studio
```

After installation, open Android Studio and follow the instructions to install the **Android SDK**, **Android Emulator**, and other necessary components.

Make sure to set up the **ANDROID_HOME** environment variable. Add the following to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Source the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### **Step 4: Create a React Native Project**

Once all dependencies are installed, you can create your first React Native project by running:

```bash
react-native init MyNewProject
cd MyNewProject
```

Now, you can start the development server:

```bash
npx react-native start
```

#### **Step 5: Run on an Emulator**

To run the app on an emulator:

1. Open **Android Studio** and start an emulator.
2. In the terminal, run:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

This will compile the project and run it on the emulator.

## **‚úÖ‚ùå Positive and Negative point of React Native**

| ‚úÖ **Positive**                                               | ‚ùå **Negative**                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cross-platform development**: React Native allows you to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android, saving time and effort in development. | **Emulator Dependency**: To test your app, you will need an Android emulator, which typically requires **Android Studio**. This is a huge drawback because Android Studio itself is **cumbersome and resource-heavy**. It‚Äôs known to be quite slow and can slow down your development process (especially on machines with less RAM). Plus, Android Studio can feel bloated and difficult to manage at times. |
| **Rich ecosystem**: Thanks to the extensive library and community, you can find a wide range of plugins, tools, and documentation. | **Performance issues on complex apps**: For extremely performance-sensitive applications, React Native may struggle to match the performance of fully native apps, especially when dealing with high-performance animations or heavy UI rendering. |
| **Fast refresh**: React Native offers a fast refresh feature, allowing developers to see updates instantly without rebuilding the entire app. | **Limited iOS development options**: On Linux (like Fedora), you won‚Äôt be able to test or build iOS apps directly, which requires a MacOS machine. |
| **Native performance**: While not fully native, React Native apps provide good performance for most use cases, especially when optimized correctly. | **Native modules complexity**: If your app requires custom native code, you‚Äôll have to deal with **native modules**, which could be a hassle when dealing with platform-specific code. It's not as simple as writing in JavaScript. |
| **Large community support**: React Native benefits from a huge community of developers, ensuring plenty of resources, support, and third-party libraries. | **Debugging**: While debugging has improved, it still lags behind native development tools, and debugging on devices or emulators can sometimes be tricky. |
