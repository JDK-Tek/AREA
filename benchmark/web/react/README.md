# Benchmark Development of a React Web App 🚀

## Introduction 📚  
This benchmark uses ReactJS and CSS technologies. The 'react-router-dom' and 'MaterialUI' frameworks were also used. The benchmark will cover the installation/launch of the app, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using these technologies.

## Installation/launch of the benchmark 🛠️

1. **Install dependencies**
    Run command: 'npm install'

2. **Add assets**
    Unzip 'assets.zip' and move the assets folder to the './src' directory

3. **Launch the Web application**
    Run command: 'npm start'

## Positive Points ✅

1. **Performance**
    ReactJS offers high performance thanks to its virtual DOM.
2. **Modularity**
    The modular structure of React allows for easy reuse of components.
3. **Ecosystem**
    A large ecosystem of libraries and tools is available for React.
4. **Community**
    A large active community that provides support and resources.

## Negative Points ❌

1. **Learning Curve**
    The learning curve can be steep for beginners.
2. **Configuration**
    Initial configuration can be complex without using create-react-app. But if you use 'create-react-app', you get a template that you can modify at your taste.
3. **Documentation**
    Documentation for some third-party libraries can be insufficient.

## Conclusion 📝

In conclusion, ReactJS is a powerful technology for developing modern web applications. Although there may be a learning curve and initial challenges, the benefits in terms of performance, modularity, and community support make it a solid choice for developers.
