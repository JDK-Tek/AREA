# Benchmark development of the AREA frontend üöÄ

## Introduction üìö
This benchmark compares the performance of three frontend technologies: ReactJS, HTML, and VueJS.

## Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
- [**ReactJS**]()
- [**HTML**]()
- [**VueJS**]()

### Performance on loading time (Lower is better)

While HTML has the fastest loading time, it lacks the dynamic capabilities and modularity provided by frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS.
<br>
VueJS, although powerful, has a significantly higher loading time compared to ReactJS.
<br>
So we think that the best one overall, that has great dynamic capabilities and loading time is the ReactJS.

### Why Choose ReactJS?
1. **Performance**: ReactJS offers a good balance between performance and functionality with its virtual DOM.
2. **Modularity**: ReactJS's component-based architecture allows for easy reuse and maintenance of code.
3. **Ecosystem**: A vast ecosystem of libraries and tools is available for ReactJS, making development faster and easier.
4. **Community Support**: ReactJS has a large and active community, providing ample resources and support.

## Conclusion üìù
Despite its higher loading time compared to HTML, we chose ReactJS to develop the AREA frontend, for its robust features, modularity, and strong community support.
<br>
These advantages make it a solid choice for developing modern, dynamic web applications.
