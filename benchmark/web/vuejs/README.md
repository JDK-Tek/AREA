# Benchmark Development of a Vue.js Web App 🚀

## Introduction 📚  
This benchmark uses Vue.js and CSS technologies. The 'vue-router' and 'Vuetify' frameworks were also used. The benchmark will cover the installation/launch of the app, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using these technologies.

## Installation/launch of the benchmark 🛠️

1. **Install dependencies**
    Run command: 'npm install'

2. **Add assets**
    Unzip 'assets.zip' and move the assets folder to the './src' directory

3. **Launch the Web application**
    Run command: 'npm run dev'

## Positive Points ✅

1. **Performance**
    Vue.js offers high performance thanks to its efficient rendering system.
2. **Modularity**
    The component-based architecture of Vue.js allows for easy reuse of components.
3. **Ecosystem**
    A growing ecosystem of libraries and tools is available for Vue.js.
4. **Community**

## Negative Points ❌

1. **Learning Curve**

2. **Configuration**
    Initial configuration can be complex without using Vue CLI. But if you use Vue CLI, you get a template that you can modify to your liking.
3. **Documentation**
    Documentation for some third-party libraries can be insufficient.

## Conclusion 📝

In conclusion, Vue.js is a powerful technology for developing modern web applications. Although there may be a learning curve and initial challenges, the benefits in terms of performance, modularity, and community support make it a solid choice for developers.
