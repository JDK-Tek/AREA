# üöÄ Benchmark Development of an HTML Web App

## üìö Introduction  
This document presents a benchmark for developing a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. It covers the deployment process, installation, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.

## üåê Deployment Process  

Deploying a web application with HTML/CSS/JS generally involves several steps:

1. **File Preparation**
2. **Local Testing**  
3. **Choosing a Web Server**
   The application can be deployed on a simple HTTP server such as Apache or Nginx, or by using a cloud service (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel).

4. **Uploading to the Server**
   To send our files to the web server, tools like `FTP`, `SFTP`, or a version control system (e.g., `Git` with GitHub or GitLab) can be used.

5. **DNS Configuration (if necessary)**
   If using a custom domain, DNS settings need to be configured to point to the server.

6. **Go Live and Testing**
   Once the files are uploaded, the application is accessed via a browser for online testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Application Installation

To install a simple web application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Project (if needed)**
   If the application is hosted on GitHub or another repository, clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/my-project.git
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**
   After downloading the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a browser.

## ‚úÖ‚ùå Advantages / Disadvantages

| **Advantages** ‚úÖ                                         | **Disadvantages** ‚ùå                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and doesn't require a complex environment. | **Functional Limitations**: HTML/CSS/JS alone is limited for complex apps, often requiring frameworks or backends. |
| **Compatibility**: Supported by almost all modern browsers, ensuring a broad user base. | **Maintenance**: Can be difficult to maintain long-term without version control or a proper architecture. |
| **Quick Deployment**: Can be quickly deployed on services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, often for free. | **Compatibility Issues**: Potential bugs in older browser versions despite modern browser support. |
| **Lightweight**: Tends to be fast to load, especially if optimized. | **Security**: Vulnerable to attacks (e.g., code injections) if not properly secured. |

## üìù Conclusion

Developing a web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript remains a popular approach for simple to moderately complex applications. The deployment process is relatively easy and fast, and there are many tools to assist with installation and going live. However, this method has limitations in terms of advanced functionality and security, which may require additional technologies.

Therefore, using this technology for our AREA project seems very limited.
